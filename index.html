            Make in BVB(MIB): With the motto of “Inspiring minds to innovate”,
            Make in BVB was started by a bunch of self-motivated students under
            CTIE(Centre for Technology Innovation and Entrepreneurship) in the
            year 2014. From then till present times it has been instilling
            entrepreneurial mindset among the youth in and around the state and
            is recognised even globally through BVB-Umass Student Exchange
            Programs. Students are exposed to entrepreneurial activities through

              Infrastructure is the basic need of every living being. Right from
              a startup to huge MNCs to function. Right from the roads we use to
              commute to the huge dams and channels. Doesn't it all seem
              marvelous and interesting? The field of civil engineering is a
              broad domain, which has place for various domains without which
              things may be difficult to run. ELVIC provides the platform to the
              interdisciplinary students to ideate the smart soutions in the
              civil engineering domain. Let's envision the technological
              evolution in the civil Engineering with this event.

            <div class="about-us-subsection-desc">
                As the name states, here students grow through their ideas. Multiple skills ranging from product development to marketing to communication skills are developed. The students can even avail the access to the maker’s space to help them in building their products. The students are assigned mentors to guide them through this phase and on the D-day, they are provided a platform to showcase their products to a huge crowd of over 1000 people consisting of students, faculties from BVB and other institutes.

                <br>
                The first PUPA was a pilot project organised with just 35 teams in 2013 even before MIB was formed. From 35 teams in the first season to over 400 teams in the present season, PUPA has seen multiple ideas, teams, their enthusiasm etc. But the one thing that remained constant through out was the time frame of 3 weeks and ₹.500 as seed capital to build the product.

                <br>
                While it proves as a learning experience to some teams, it’s a start of entrepreneurial journey for the others in building their own start-ups.
