                        Pupa is a mega event of Make in BVB(MiB) where students from all over the state get exposure to
                        learn multiple skills ranging from product development to marketing to communication skills. MiB
                        provides mentorship and also seed funding for product development and PUPA gives them the
                        platform to showcase their products.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The students are mentored extensively for product development and also motivated when they feel
                        low in the process . Along with this, students are also guided regarding the marketing of their
                        product. PUPA gives students a great opportunity to interact with investors and if the product
                        is unique and innovative then investors give them fundings too .
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        PUPA helps students to widen their horizon of knowledge in every sector. This gives them an
                        opportunity to stand tall amongst the crowd. In PUPA 2019 there were approximately 500 students
                        from all over Karnataka and other states who participated and enjoyed the event.
