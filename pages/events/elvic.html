                        Imagine your lives without roads, buildings and infrastructure.Doesn't it seem scary? Right from a startup to huge MNCs to function. Right from the roads we use to commute to the huge dams and channels. Doesn't it all seem marvelous and interesting?
                        <br>

The field of civil engineering is a broad domain, which has place for various domains without which things may be difficult to run. We've progressed from huge man-made structures that took a long time to be built to structures that have been built in no time. This has been possible due to involvement of various disciplines like Electronics, Mechanical, Artificial Intelligence, Automation and many more.
<br>
<br>
Civil engineering, being one of the oldest branches of engineering, plays a significant role. Though science and technologies are booming in microseconds, civil engineering sector has massive scope for improvement in that area. Construction and Infrastructure has become the essential aspect now-a-days. Construction is taking place everywhere these days and scope for improvement in that area is huge. Not only major Civil Domains, but different domains can also collaborate and work on a solution. It's open for all teams- hardware, software and blend of both.
<br>
<br>
ELVIC is an event which gives the platform for the enthusiastic teams to ideate the Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning, Additive manufacturing, ESDM (Electronics System Design and Manufacturing) or any open domain solutions for the problem statements formulated by industry experts. It's an event in collaboration with Jalavahini and Marketing Cell.
<br>
<br>
Participants across the country have to voice out their designed solution in front of the prominent judges. The best ideas get a chance of incubation under CTIE (Center for Technology Innovation and Entrepreneurship) and winners will be honoured with a cash prize upto INR 25,000.
Yes!! We are eagerly waiting for remarkable ideas which can bring pronounced technological advancements in the civil engineering sector.
